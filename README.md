### Hi there 👋

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with over 5 years of solid experience in React, Node.js, TypeScript, and Python. I enjoy solving problems with technology and work with CSS/SASS, Git, RESTful APIs, and both SQL and NoSQL databases. In startups, I built MVPs from scratch, turning early ideas into platforms that reached global scale. I care about code quality, system security, and performance, and I have strong experience with AWS, which I think is a great tool. I am also an AI enthusiast who works on small projects with LangChain and uses ChatGPT daily to learn and solve challenges the right way. I believe my skills and experience match the job requirements, and I am excited to join the team.

Some things about me:

- 🔭 I have finished a master's degree in information systems at [IPB](https://portal3.ipb.pt/index.php/pt/ipb), Bragança, in Portugal 
- ⛏ I am very proud to have helped to structure [Commit Jr](https://commitjr.com) (Junior Computer Engineering Company of CEFET-MG), where now, I work training new members and guiding the construction of solutions for customers.
